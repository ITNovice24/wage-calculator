## **What it does** 
 Calculates hourly wages for the week by taking a user input. The script will not account for overtime. The script will assume weekly wage doesn't change and calculate a monthly wage. If the user specifies that their weekly hours changed, the program will only calculate total wages for the weeks worked. :dollar:
